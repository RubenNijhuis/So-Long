### Notes
This project started during my academic year '21 at Codam. Due to a norm they have for the code certain functions
might be written in 'interesting' ways. In most cases these functions would be written in a differently structured
way improving speed or memory usage.

This library will scale with the functionality I require during my time at Codam. Therefore some functions that might
be obvious for you to use won't be added as I don't have a use for them.

Happy coding :)
